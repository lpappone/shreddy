  <h1>Welcome Dinner</h1>
  <div>Friday, August 26th, 2016</div>
  <p>6:30 pm at Squabetty</p>
  <p class="textblock">If you're in town Friday, please join us for a casual outdoor dinner. We'll have food coming out around 6:30, but we'd love for you to come by earlier in the day and take advantage of Squabetty. It's a beautiful spot, including a wood-fired sauna and stream fed pool (bring a swimsuit!). So come as early in the afternoon as you'd like. We'll have snacks, drinks, and lawn games, and we can't wait to see you!</p>
