    <h1>Camping</h1>
    <img src="{{ "/assets/squabetty.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
    <p>You are welcome (and encouraged!) to camp on-site. Squabetty has a HUGE yard, so there is plenty of space to spread out and set up a tent, or sleep under the stars. We'd love to have the extra hang out time and save you the hassle of traveling back and forth. You can shower/primp for the party in the house, and if it rains, worst case, you can stay dry in the barn or under the tent we'll have set up. If you need to borrow camping gear, let us know.</p>
